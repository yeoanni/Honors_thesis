### Key Points:
- **Rank Reduction:** This method focuses on rank reduction by using the largest singular values, allowing the transition matrix to be low-rank, even if the empirical matrix isnâ€™t.
- **Data Compression:** The method still performs data compression, which is particularly important when dealing with high-dimensional transition matrices.
- **Projection to the Simplex:** The method projects the frequency estimates onto the probability simplex, ensuring that the rows of \(\hat{P}\) remain valid probability distributions.

1. **Input:** A trajectory of observed states \(\{X_1, \dots, X_n\}\) and the known rank \(r\), which is the target rank for the low-rank transition matrix.
   
2. **Construct Empirical Matrices:** From the observed trajectory, the empirical frequency matrix \(\hat{F}\) is constructed. This matrix encodes the frequency with which transitions between different states occur, based on the sample path. \(\hat{P}\) is the normalized version of this matrix, representing transition probabilities between states.

3. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** Apply SVD to \(\hat{F}\), decomposing it into three matrices:
     \[
     \hat{F} = U_{\Sigma} \Sigma_F V_F^\top
     \]
     where \(U_{\Sigma}\) and \(V_F\) are orthogonal matrices and \(\Sigma_F\) is a diagonal matrix of singular values.

4. **Frequency Estimation:** The next step is to compute \(\hat{F}_0\), which is the top-r rank approximation of \(\hat{F}\). This is done by selecting the largest \(r\) singular values and the corresponding singular vectors. This helps in reducing the dimensionality while preserving the most significant transitions.

5. **Estimating the Transition Matrix:** Using the frequency matrix \(\hat{F}_0\), the estimated transition matrix \(\hat{P}\) is derived. Specifically, the entries of \(\hat{P}\) are calculated as:
     \[
     \hat{P}_{i, \cdot} = \frac{\hat{F}_{i, \cdot}}{\sum_{j=1}^p \hat{F}_{i,j}} \quad \text{if} \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{F}_{i,j} > 0
     \]
     and
     \[
     \hat{P}_{i, \cdot} = \frac{1}{p} 1_p^\top \quad \text{if} \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{F}_{i,j} = 0
     \]
     This normalization ensures that each row of \(\hat{P}\) sums to 1, preserving the properties of a Markov transition matrix.

The output of the algorithm consists of \(\hat{P}\), the estimated low-rank transition matrix, and \(\hat{F}\), the empirical frequency matrix.
